# Manual Approval Action

A GitHub Action that creates an approval request issue and waits for approvals from designated reviewers before proceeding with your workflow.

## Overview

This action helps implement manual approval gates in your GitHub Actions workflows. When triggered, it:

1. Creates a new GitHub issue requesting approval
2. Pauses the workflow execution
3. Monitors the issue comments for approval or denial messages
4. Continues or cancels the workflow based on the approvers' decisions

## Features

- ‚úÖ Customizable approval request titles and messages
- ‚úÖ Support for multiple approvers
- ‚úÖ Configurable minimum number of approvals
- ‚úÖ Cross-repository issue creation
- ‚úÖ Timeout functionality
- ‚úÖ Exclude workflow initiator as an approver
- ‚úÖ Additional approved and denied words
- ‚úÖ Fail workflow on denial
- ‚úÖ Customizable issue title and body
- ‚úÖ Customizable labelling
- ‚úÖ Automatic issue closing after workflow completion
- ‚úÖ Lock issue as resolved, when approved or denied

## Installation

This action is available in the GitHub Actions Marketplace. Simply reference it in your workflow file:

```yaml
- name: Manual Approval Step
  uses: showoffninja/manual-approval-action-ts@v1
  with:
    secret: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    approvers: user1,user2,user3
    minimum-approvals: 2
    exclude-workflow-initiator-as-approver: false
```

## Example Workflow

## How Manual Approval Works

1. When the action runs, it creates a new issue in the specified repository
2. The workflow `pauses` and waits for comments
3. Designated approvers can comment on the issue:

- To approve: Comment with `"approved"`, `"approve"`, `"lgtm"`, or `"yes"`
- To deny: Comment with `"denied"`, `"deny"`, or `"no"`

4. The action monitors the issue comments and look for the specified keywords. The logic filters out comments and sentences that are more than 1 word to avoid false positives.
5. Once the required number of approvals is reached, the workflow continues
6. If the request is denied and `fail-on-denial` is enabled, the workflow will fail; otherwise, denial of approval will cause the workflow to be `cancelled`
7. After completion, the issue is automatically closed
